The mobile application should simplify the search for the perfect or favorite cocktail and save the tedious search time for cocktail recipes on the Internet.
Users can easily search for a cocktail of their choice in the search option and click on the cocktail to find the corresponding recipe for self-preparation.
If the choice of a cocktail is unclear, you can easily find a list of different types of cocktails using the All-Cocktail option.
